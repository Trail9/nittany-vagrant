    <h1>Welcome to Nittany Vagrant!</h1>
    <p>
      If you are seeing this file it means that you either really know what your doing OR you aren't done! Now instead of getting to this file, you'll want to open up terminal / command line, go to the directory this is installed in and run the following:<br/>
      <strong>vagrant ssh</strong>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      From there we'll walk you through the rest of the setup process by asking a series of questions. In the future, that wizard will hopefully take the place of this page. Until then, we hope you enjoy using Nittany Vagrant. Please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/psudug/nittany-vagrant" target="_blank">submit issues and ideas to the issue queue</a>.
