Step 1: Download Vagrant
Step 2: Download Virtual Box
Step 3: Clone this repository onto you local machine
Step 4: Cd in the directory
Step 5: run the command vagrant up
Step 6: Go make a coffee
Step 7: Add the following to your hosts file (please note the hosts file is in different places on different OS)

-- Windows
Edit C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

Add these lines somewhere in the file
# DUG Vagrant
192.168.56.101  drupal7.dev
192.168.56.101  drupal8.dev
192.168.56.101  www.drupal7.dev
192.168.56.101  www.drupal8.dev


-- OSX
Edit /etc/hosts

Add these lines somewhere in the file
# DUG Vagrant
192.168.56.101  drupal7.dev
192.168.56.101  drupal8.dev
192.168.56.101  www.drupal7.dev
192.168.56.101  www.drupal8.dev

Step 8: go to either http://drupal7.dev or http://drupal8.dev in your browser.
  -- Drupal 7 will already be installed with some modules turned on for you.
  user name = admin
  password = pass
If you would like more modules out of the box please file an issue here and I will add them. This is just a starting point.

  -- Drupal 8 has only been downloaded for you with an empty database set up. The dbname and dbusername is drupal8 and the password is 123. If you want to play around with it, run through the installer by going to http://drupal8.dev in your browser.

To Access a database UI go to http://192.168.56.101/adminer. It is pretty easy to use and at somepoint I may add phpmyadmin if there are any requests for it.

HAPPY DRUPALING!
